## Hi all!

I'm Josh (they/them), a Winter '22 graduate of the University of Michigan's College of Engineering and the lab manager for the [Welch Lab](https://welch-lab.github.io/) in the Medical School. I aspire to develop new experimental and computational methodologies for the high throughput analysis of cultured and uncultured environmental microbiomes.
