### Opportunities

I'm always open to collaborations and consulting! 

* Currently, I am most interested in working remotely with an experimentalist in environmental microbiology to analyze ecological data with both common statistical techniques and novel methodologies.
* If you think my background would be relevant to any other type of project, reach out and I'd consider helping out.
* I would happily work on visualization and dissemination of socially impactful research and other initiatives.
* I enjoy discussing admissions and general career planning with high schoolers and undergrads. I can advise generally on STEM careers but am very knowledgeable on biology and genomics in particular. I will give feedback on any materials you send my way and will make time to meet if you'd prefer.
